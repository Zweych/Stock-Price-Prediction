Title :

Comparative Analysis of BiLSTM Deep Learning Model and Random Forest Regressor Performance on Indonesian Nickel Mining Company Stock Prices

Abstract :

The stocks of nickel mining companies in Indonesia are one of the most influential stocks in the global economy. Understanding its price movement is quite complicated, it requires an advanced technique to process it. This research provides investors with better information regarding nickel mining companies and prediction techniques using prediction models, allowing investors to create more successful strategies with lower investment risks. Thus, allowing small investors to compete with institutional players. This study focuses on comparing the accuracy of two stock prediction models, i.e. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Random Forest (RF), in predicting the stock prices of a nickel mining company in Indonesia, Antam (Aneka Tambang) using a dataset from Yahoo Finance with several forecast time frame as the comparison. The evaluation metrics we use to compare the accuracy of the two models are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results of this study showed that the BiLSTM model has a lower error compared to the RF model, although in terms of training time and computational resource usage, the RF model shows a much better efficiency than the BiLSTM model. The RMSE shows that the BiLSTM model error is 0.0568633, while the RF model error is 0.0746966 for the short forecast time frame. For the long forecast time frame, the BiLSTM model error is 0.0753416, while the RF model error is 0.1549706. The RF model's performance deteriorates significantly as the forecast time frame lengthens, indicating a strong inverse correlation between the model's accuracy and the length of the forecast time window. The results demonstrate the exceptional capability of the BiLSTM model in making the right decision in predicting the stock price of nickel mining companies.
